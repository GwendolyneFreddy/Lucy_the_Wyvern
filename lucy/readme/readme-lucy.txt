I.     Overview

The mod adds an alternate outcome to meeting Lucy, the wyvern in the Adventure Mart.


II.    Compatibility

This mod is designed to work with Baldur's Gate 2, Shadows of Amn,
with or without the Throne of Bhaal expansion.

Because this mod reassigns Lucy's DV, it will not be compatible with other mods that use this DV. 
As far as I know, there are none. The new DV is "lucy".


III.   Installation

Windows 
Lucy the Wyvern is packaged and installed with WeiDU. If properly extracted, 
you should have a "lucy" folder and setup-lucy.exe in your game directory. 
To install, simply double-click setup-lucy.exe and follow the instructions on screen. 

Mac OSX
If the mod was previously installed, uninstall it before extracting the new version. 

Lucy is packaged and installed with WeiDU. To install, simply extract the contents of 
the mod into your BG2 game folder. If properly extracted, you should have a "lucy" folder, 
setup-lucy, and setup-lucy.command in your BG2 game folder. To install, simply double-click 
setup-lucy.command and follow the instructions on screen. To uninstall or reinstall, run 
setup-lucy.command again.


IV.   Contents
